      <p class="sponsorP">The application is designed to prevent and discourage drunk driving by providing the user with their blood alcohol content (BAC). Driving while under the influence is 100% preventable, and Drink, Drank, Drunk is another tool for responsible drivers to use to further prevent driving drunk. Having an application right on driver’s phones is convenient and will eliminate all excuses.
        <br>
        Drink, Drank, Drunk has been sponsored by one of London's most popular and longest running desigated driver services, Diamondz DD.</p>

      <h2 class="techSpecsH">Tech Specs</h2>
      <p class="techSpecsP">
        Drink, Drank, Drunk will be a primarily mobile application, because the ideal user will be out of the house, away from a computer, enjoying their night. This ideal user is smart phone savvy, and can easily pull up the application on their
        smart phone device, rather than need a computer. In order to create this application I have used technologies including Foundation 5 grid framework, Codeigniter MVC framework, and PhoneGap.
        <br>
        <br>
        Java-script has been used to create the front-end for the application. I have used Java-script to control the equations to calculate the user’s blood alcohol content, with decreasing time from consumption. In order to display the user’s Blood Alcohol Content I used Chart.js a Java-script library.
        <br>
        <br>
        The back-end approach have taken is using an MVC pattern and a PHP framework, Codeigniter. The back-end stores data including user login, user profile, and alcohol information.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to get Drink, Drank, Drunk onto the apple and android store I have wrapped the application with PhoneGap. PhoneGap is an open source framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using PhoneGap will eliminate the need to write in native development languages, specific to each platforms operating system. Once the application is wrapped, it will be able to be placed in multiple app stores ( iTunes app store, Google play store, etc.).

      <p class="developerP">Hi, I'm Julie! I am a multidisciplinary designer and developer creating clean works of art for the internet. After three years of design, I felt like I was missing a piece of the puzzle, in order to become the well rounded designer I wanted to be. That being said, I took on the challenge of becoming a developer, and haven’t looked back. Solving visual problems with passion and logic is my speciality.</p>
